Both have the same columns, and each row is a U.S. metropolitan area, with data on population, education, and unemployment. The first `csv` file contains metropolitan areas starting with A-K, and the second starting with L-Z. Read both into `pandas` data frames, using the column `GEO.id2` as an index. Be careful, as these files have **two** lines that might be considered header lines.  The first one is more descriptive, and the second one is more concise and give succint variable names.  So when we read from the csv, we want to **skip** the first line and then use the second line as the header line.  The `pandas` `read_csv` constructor can do this for you, but you have to discover and use the correct arguments.\n",
