    "The projects in this class serve some additional objectives that reach beyond what lectures, in-class hands-on engagement, and homeworks can provide.  Some of these objectives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Working with real-world data sets that have greater volume and scale,\n",
    "- Getting beyond the pigeon-hole thinking that can come from solving the relatively small problems involved in homework exercises,\n",
    "- Thinking about the data itself, and the information the study of that data can provide, \n",
    "- Building up a larger whole, synthesized from many of the low-level skills and operations, and\n",
    "- Effectively communicating what was learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a \"normal\" semester, our approach would be to make a project like this almost fully self-defined, and to provide only high-level guidance.  Students would use a combination of discovering what they wanted to explore and how to do so through their own investigation along with meetings and refinement with the course instructor.  In our COVID semester of Fall 2020, we provide a structured progression, documented in Parts 1 through 4 of this notebook.  \n",

    "As offered in class, for extra credit applied to the quiz portion of your grade, you can \"go beyond\" and build upon the techniques and the data explored in this notebook and do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract additional tidy tables of \"useful\" information from the data set,\n",
    "2. Define at least two, and possibly more interesting questions about the data,\n",
    "3. Build visualizations that can help answer the questions from #2, based on the data,\n",
    "4. Using best practices in writing, construct an essay that describes and documents your exploration, presents your visualizations, interprets your results, and generates a coherent conclusion.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are over 2.5 million borrowers in 84 countries involved with Kiva. With a 97.1 repayment rate, the 1.6 million lenders have lent over 1 billion dollars. Most of the loans are very very smallAs Kiva is a nonprofit, it has developers worldwide and has shared its data. \n",

For the purpose of this project, we will focus on the XML files (rather than JSON files) containing the data from 2005-2017. We will start this project by using `partners.xml`."

The reason for multiple files is that the API to search for loans limits the number of returned results to a single logical **page**.  In this case, a page contains information on 100 loans, and the process to obtain results was repeated 10 times to get the first 10 pages of loan information.
