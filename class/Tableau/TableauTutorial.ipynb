    "    \n",
    "    1. Who's the worst offender globaly for $CO_2$ emissions?\n",

    "    2. Have $CO_2$ emissions risen in the last 30 years?\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/TableauExample.jpg\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the first graph, two different dimensions/metrics are being shown. First, the size of a country's circle relates to the amount of $CO_2$ emissions they release. The bigger the circle, the more emissions. Additionally, there's a color scale. The more red the circle, the more that country is producing $CO_2$ disproportionately to their population. The second graph measures $CO_2$ emissions over time. Looking at the data we have here, it seems apparent that Qatar is the worst offender of $CO_2$ emissions. The purpose of the second visualization is to take a closer look. \n",

    "At this point, we should have four distinct sheets, one for each of the visualizations developed in this practicum.  They are named `Sheet 1`, `Sheet 2`, `Sheet 3`, and `Sheet 4`.  When working with visualizations, particularly targeted for an online or interactive presence, we often want to group them together into a **Dashboard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want meaningful names for each of the worksheets we want to gather together into a singledashboard.  Right click on each sheet in the lower left corner, and select *Rename Sheet*\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can name them whatever makes the most sense to you, but we have chosed `State Map`, `Weather Trends`, `State Trends1`, and `State Trends2`, respectively.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Next to the *New Sheet* button, click *New Dashboard* instead\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![dashboard](figs/dashboard.jpg)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the panel on the left at the top, you should see *Dashboard* and *Size* subpanels.  Change the *Size* from `Fixed` to `Automatic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In the panel on the left, you should see a *Sheets* subpanel with your four sheets listed. Drag your *State Map* sheet onto your dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![dash1](figs/dash1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "    As you can see, your dashboard now consists of your first sheet, with the key being automatically transposed ontop of it. If the legend is not helpful, you can click on it as an individual item and remove it from the dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Move the rest of your sheets onto your dashboard.  As you drag, the display will shade the area so that you know how the tiled arrangement of sheets within the dashboard will be placed.  In our dashboard, we chose the box-and-whiskers to appear across the full width.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![dash2](figs/dash3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. One of the advantages of interactive visualizations is that the user can use the mouse to get more detailed (filtered) information.  Click your *State Map* visualization on the dashboard, then click the third icon down, which looks like a funnel button.  It should give the feedback to \"Use as a Filter\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Try clicking on a particular state on the map.  Then click the same state again.  Hopefully you can see and appreciate the value of using one representation/sheet to act as a filter for the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![dash4](figs/dash4.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If the box and whiskers is too busy, but we know that our dashboard is going to be interactive, we can change how that particular worksheet is \"Fit\" in the dashboard.  Click on the `State Trends 2` sheet and, using the drop down, select *Fit*->*Standard*.  This brings back the horizontal scroll bar so that you can navigate the visualization to see all fifty states.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![dash5](figs/dash5.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finish by saving your work (i.e. the complete Tableau \"Book\").  Also, with your final dashboard being displayed, from the Menu select\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dashboard*->*Export Image ...*\n",
    "\n",
    "and select a jpeg image, and give a name `tableau_practicum.jpg`.  This is the file you will upload to Notebowl to demonstrate your completion of the practicum.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Obviously Tableau contains much more than we went over in this tutorial, but the best way to learn is to explore. Additionally, this link: https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources covers many of the topics we went over in video form. Happy visualizing!"
