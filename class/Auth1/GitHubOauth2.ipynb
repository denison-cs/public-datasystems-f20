    "This **Oauth Flow** is used when the client/app/consumer of data is **separate** from the user, and when the app needs to access protected resources maintainded by the Provider on behalf of the user.  Note that there is another type of delegated authority OAuth Flow, the **implicit code grant**.  In this flow, the User redirect to the Provider and the subsequent redirect back to the App yields the token directly.  This suffers from the lack of authentication between the App and the Provider, but can simplify the process when the Resource Owner and the App are closely aligned.\n",

So we will use a `creds.json` file that can be both read and updated by this notebook, and would be read by another notebook in order to be able to see the tokens created here.  We can also use it to store something like the authorization redirect url, to be able to shortcut its creation."
