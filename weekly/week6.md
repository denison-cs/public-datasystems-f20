JSON-based COVID-19 data processing.

## Progression

We start the week working to understand the structure of the hierarchical model with allied concepts of paths to represent traversals through that structure.  From this, we then look at the two most common formats for representing hierarchical data: JSON and XML.  We can immediately understand some of the procedural (tree) operations on JSON data, as it only relies on nested Python data structure, which we have seen before.  By the end of the week, we introduce analogous procedural tree operations for XML-based data structures.
