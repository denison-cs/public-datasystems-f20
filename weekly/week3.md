IC_1.2 | Tuesday | Wednesday | Access Elements, Rows, Columns
HW_1.6 | Wednesday | Friday | Access Combinations, Iteration
IC_1.3 | Friday | Monday | Review Problem Set

## Tuesday Problem Day

Pandas dataframe creation and fundamental access operations.


## Progression

Goal of the week is to  introduce data models in general, the tabular model in particular, and for that model, understand the structure, tidy data structural constraints, and realization and access operations using the `pandas` module.

Monday: Primarily a conceptual lecture covering data models and their purpose followed by tabular model and tidy data, with emphasis on understanding the variables and values in a data set.  Conclude with constructing `pandas` data frames.

Tuesday:  Problem day, building on `pandas` data frame construction and perhaps `pandas` tutorial, and getting to column projection and simple row selection.

Wednesday: More complex row and column and combinations.  Procedural access through iteration.

Friday: Tabular formats and considerations, wrap any loose ends on chapter 7 coverage.
