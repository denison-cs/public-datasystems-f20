## Progression

This week, we begin the third of our data models covering the *forms* of data treated in this course, namely the *relational database model*.  In addition, we move from our exclusive use of local files as the *source* of our data to one where the data may be maintained and shared over a network where a server hosts the relational database.

Monday will highlight the most important aspects of the model, with its structure and typical architectures.  We will introduce and define many terms we will need over the next three weeks.  Monday's treatment will give a glimpse at one of the core advantages of databases: **design before data population**.

Wednesday and Friday will focus on the SQL language and its use in declaring the data desired from single tables in a database, from column projection and row selection to computing on column-vectors of a result to performing partitioning and aggregation.
