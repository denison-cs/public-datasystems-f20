## Tuesday Problem Day

- Quiz3

## Progression

We begin the week by developing the abstractions, interface, and techniques for relational database programming in Python.  After the quiz on Tuesday, which will focus on SQL and XPath, we launch into some of the most important principles for when we need to create **our own** databases.  This will revisit some of the tidy data principles and then extend to being intentional about the relationships between tables in a database.  SQL for table creation and for population of tables with data will be covered as time permits.
