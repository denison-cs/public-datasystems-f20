## Progression

The work of the week will be roughly split up by treating multi-table SQL on Monday and Wednesday, and developing the abstractions, interface, and techniques for relational database programming on Friday.  The focus on Monday will be in joining tables using inner and outer joins.  This will be reinforced with some problems on Tuesday and the homework for Wednesday night.  On Wednesday, we see how these composite/joined table give us additional power when we do group by and aggregation, and also how we can use a subquery, often which contains a joined table, as part of a larger query.

The focus of Friday is the integration of what we have learned in SQL with the programmatic techniques of "making it happen" in Python, when we are not using SQL magics or third-party client tools.
