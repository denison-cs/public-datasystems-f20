## Progression

Our goals for the week are

1. To practice using the documentation given by a provider and translating that into client code in order to perform our data acquisition.  

2. To understand better the separation of resource owners from our client application(s) and the steps of the OAuth dance by which a resource owner can convey permission to a client to obtain data on their behalf.

We will use Monday and Tuesday for the first, with an instructor-led progression on Monday and student-driven problem solving on Tuesday.  For the second, we will cover the concepts and use instructor-led on Wednesday and student-driven practice on Friday.
