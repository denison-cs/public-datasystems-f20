## Tuesday Problem Day

> Currently thinking of an in-class practicum that gives us experience at defining a relational database and creating tables and possibly some table population.  These were not able to be covered as much in lecture, nor with homework this semester, so would give at least a bit of exposure.

## Progression

A lot of the week will be transitional, as we move to the foundations we need to understand the data-sources dimension to this course.  In particular, we need to understand the architecture and terminology involved in networking and the use of layers of protocols to decompose a difficult problem into solvable components.  From there, we start a deeper exploration of HTTP, which we must both understand and rely on for accomplishing the data acquisition over the network encompassed in the work of the rest of the semester.
