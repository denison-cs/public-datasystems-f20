## Progression

The focus of the week is HTTP, deepening our understanding of different types of requests and processing of replies.  This involves, on requests, controlling the HTTP method (GET and POST), the values of header key-value pairs, augmenting the resource path with query string key-value pairs and, for POST, including a **body** that contains information for the request.  On response, we need to be able to understand and accommodate encodings, to get meta-information about the response through the headers in the response, and processing the body of the response.
