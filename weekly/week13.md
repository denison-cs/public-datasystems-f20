## Progression

There is little new data systems concepts to introduce this week.  We start the week with web scraping.  This is primarily an application of the tree structured format from earlier in the semester, and  using it to extract two-dimensional data contained within web pages, and acquiring the data through HTTP.  Similarly, learning about APIs is more about understanding the provider's requirements for requests and translating to the proper HTTP for making the requests.
